# Exploring Moons (with data analysis for now)

In this notebook, we are going to be leveraging data analysis to extract some interesting insights from a dataset that describes the natural satellites (fancy science-y word for moons) in the Solar System. 

For the analysis, we will be using some of Python's most popular libraries - numpy, pandas, and re, for data manipulation and matplotlib and seaborn for visualizing the data. So let's dive in.

Personally, I had a lot of fun exploring this data since I used to be space geek (as a kid which was long long ago.. sigh).
